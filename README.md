# Workshop_eval_reports
## Semi-automated reporting on workshop evaluations using RMarkdown
 
### Notes:
 
 Some manual editing to each RMD file is required, and once a report is generated, the document is edited manually in MS Word track changes by co-authors. Thus, the RMD generated reports are NOT FINAL.  
 
 For a new report, make a copy of one of the other RMD files, and edit line-by-line as needed. (This could likely be improved/fully automated in the future...)
 
### To do:

- Fully automate report generation
- Automate survey creation? (Currently, surveys are created in Google Forms. Perhaps there is an R tool to do this...)
